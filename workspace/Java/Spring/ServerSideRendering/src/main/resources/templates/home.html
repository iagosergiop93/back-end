            Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. What the devil. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.

            Happy painting, God bless. It takes dark in order to show light. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.

            See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. There are no limits in this world. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.
