# What is Java?

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.

Java is platform independent, which means the same Java code can be run in  different platforms. Java code is compiled in byte code that can be interpreted in a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java was developed under the principle WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) to tackle the problem of having to develop and maintain a different version of code for each platform.

Java is secured and robust, it uses strong memory management, there is automatic garbage collection, there is a lack of explicit pointers which avoids security problems.

## Java Features

* Object Oriented
* Platform independent
* Secured
* Robust
* Portable
* High Performance
* Dynamic (it support dynamic loading of classes)

## JDK x JRE

The JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment it provides Java libraries and the JVM, the Java Virtual Machine. The JRE provides everything that is needed to execute a Java program. The JDK stands for Java Development Kit, and it contains all the tools needed to develop and run a Java program, including the JRE, the Java compiler and debugger.
